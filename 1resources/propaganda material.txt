 Browser Extension: Get reddit post with every google search. 

Checkout this Chrome/Firefox extension that shows reddit posts on google search page. This extension shows relevant reddit post every time you google something.

The idea is to add any website of your liking. Here I have used reddit as an example. I have found some pretty interesting reddit links/post this way when googling with the extension. 
Say you are a graphic designer and you have a forum website that helps with graphic design problems. You might add it to the extension menu and the extension gets the relevant post from that website every time you google.
